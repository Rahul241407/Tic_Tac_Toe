# Tic-Tac-Toe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Project Description

This project is a classic implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid, aiming to be the first to align three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. It’s a fun and interactive way to demonstrate basic front-end web development skills.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against a friend in this turn-based game. The interface switches between Player X and Player O automatically.
- **Dynamic Interface**: The game board is built using JavaScript, allowing for dynamic updates and interaction with the players.
- **Winner Detection**: The game includes logic to detect winning combinations or a draw, and displays the result at the end of each game.
- **Responsive Design**: The game board is styled to be responsive and works well on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the game board and elements.
- **CSS**: Styles the board and controls the visual layout to create a user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the game logic, player turns, and updates to the game board based on player actions.

## How to Play

1. Open the game by clicking the live demo link below.
2. The first player (X) clicks on a cell in the grid to make their move.
3. The second player (O) then clicks on an empty cell to make their move.
